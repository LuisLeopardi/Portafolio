            I am a passionate web developer who loves to build elegant websites, I believe that a website must be built in a simple 
            yet beautiful that makes it easy to navigate and search for content. Learning new things is very important for a developer; 
            especially when technology advances as fast as it is doing it right now, and I am not afraid of learning new ways to improve 
            my skills.
